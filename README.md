Sometimes when you try compile the solution, you will get 
"Error		Circular file references are not allowed."

(this happened when I copied Master1 (site.master) and Master2 (default.master) some references jumbled on their own//)

It is a bug in visual studio compiler (when vs wants to deploy rather than only compile),
Just try again and it should compile fine.
